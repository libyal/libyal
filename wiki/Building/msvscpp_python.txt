== Python-bindings ==
To compile the ${python_bindings_name} Python-bindings you'll need the Python development files which are part of the Python.org windows installer package.

The Microsoft Visual Studio files are configured to look in:
{{{
C:\Python2.7\
}}}

If you want to have the Python development files in a different location you'll have to change the pyyal Microsoft Visual Studio settings.

Note that the VSDebug build of the Python-bindings will fail since the Python development files do not come with python2.7_d.lib.

If you do not intend to build the Python-bindings you can safely ignore build errors regarding: ${python_bindings_name}.
