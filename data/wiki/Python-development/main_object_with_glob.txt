# Open ${development_main_object}

```
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object} = ${python_bindings_name}.${development_main_object}()
${development_main_object_pre_open_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open(["${development_main_object_filename}"])
${development_main_object_post_open_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close()
```

The explicit call to ${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close() is not required.

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open() requires a list of all 
the necessary filenames. You can use the ${python_bindings_name}.glob() to 
obtain a list of available filenames from "${development_main_object_filename}", e.g.
```
filenames = ${python_bindings_name}.glob("${development_main_object_filename}")

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open(filenames)
```

# Open ${development_main_object} using a file-like object

```
file_object = open("${development_main_object_filename}", "rb")

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object} = ${python_bindings_name}.${development_main_object}()
${development_main_object_pre_open_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open_file_objects([file_object])
${development_main_object_post_open_file_object_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close()
```

The explicit call to ${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close() is not required.

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open_file_objects() requires a 
list of all the necessary file objects.
