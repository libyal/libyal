${project_name} comes with Python-bindings named ${python_bindings_name}.

Below are examples how use ${python_bindings_name}.
They assume you have a working version of ${python_bindings_name} on your system.
To build ${python_bindings_name} see [Building](Building).

# Import

To be able to use ${python_bindings_name} in your Python scripts add the following import:

```
import ${python_bindings_name}
```

# Get version

The get_version() module function can be used to retrieve the version of the ${python_bindings_name}.

```
${python_bindings_name}.get_version()
```

This will return a textual string (Unicode) that contains the ${project_name} version.
Since ${python_bindings_name} is a wrapper around ${project_name} it does not have a separate version.
