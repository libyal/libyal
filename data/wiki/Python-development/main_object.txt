# Open ${development_main_object}

## Open a ${development_main_object} by path

```
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object} = ${python_bindings_name}.${development_main_object}()
${development_main_object_pre_open_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open("${development_main_object_filename}")
${development_main_object_post_open_python}
...

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close()
```

The explicit call to ${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close() is not required. Close only must be called once all operations on the ${development_main_object} have been completed.

## Open a ${development_main_object} using a file-like object

```
file_object = open("${development_main_object_filename}", "rb")

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object} = ${python_bindings_name}.${development_main_object}()
${development_main_object_pre_open_python}
${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.open_file_object(file_object)
${development_main_object_post_open_file_object_python}
...

${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close()
```

The explicit call to ${development_prefix}_${development_main_object}.close() is not required. Close only must be called once all operations on the ${development_main_object} have been completed and will not close the file-like object itself.
