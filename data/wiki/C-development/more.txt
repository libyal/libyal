### Get local path

**TODO describe**

${project_name}_${development_main_object}_get_utf8_local_path

Internally ${project_name} uses both ASCII and Unicode (UTF-16 little-endian) strings, as stored in the LNK file.
ASCII strings in a LNK file contain an extended ASCII string using the codepage of the system it was created on.
The ${project_name}_set_ascii_codepage function allows to set the required codepage for reading and writing. The default codepage is Windows 1252.

Unsupported extended characters are replaced to the Unicode replacement character (U+fffd).
