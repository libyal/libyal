# Using Debian package tools (DEB)

To build ${project_name} using the Debian package tools make sure you have the following packages installed:
```
sudo apt install build-essential debhelper fakeroot autotools-dev ${dpkg_build_dependencies}
```

If you downloaded the source using git make sure to run ./configure at least once to generate the dpkg packaging files.

To build the Debian packages change into the source directory and run:
```
cp -rf dpkg debian
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
```

This will create the following files in the parent directory:
```
${dpkg_filenames}
```

To install, e.g. the library:
```
sudo dpkg -i ${project_name}_<version>-1_<arch>.deb
```

## Troubleshooting

```
dpkg-source: error: can't build with source format '3.0 (quilt)': no upstream tarball' found at ../${project_name}-<version>.orig.tar.{bz2,gz,lzma,xz}
```

This means dpkg-buildpackage cannot find the source distribution package. Make sure it is provided as:
```
../${project_name}-<version>.orig.tar.gz
```
