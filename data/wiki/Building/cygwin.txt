## Cygwin
If you want to use Cygwin to build ${project_name} make sure to have the following packages installed:

${cygwin_build_dependencies}

After following the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) build instructions you should end up with the following DLL:
```
${project_name}/.libs/${cygwin_dll_filename}
```
${cygwin_executables}

### Using the DLL
Make sure you use define ${project_name:upper_case}_DLL_IMPORT before including <${project_name}.h>.

To be able to use the DLL on other systems than the build system you'll also need to provide:

${cygwin_dll_dependencies}
