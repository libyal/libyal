## Git

**Note that the git repository holds the development version of the source code.**

**If you are not developing it is recommended that you download a source distribution package instead.**

To retrieve the source from the git repository make sure to install:

${git_build_dependencies}

To download and prepare the source for building run:
```
git clone ${project_git_url}
cd ${project_name}/
./synclibs.sh
./autogen.sh
```

The source from the git repository will not work without synchronizing the library dependencies "./synclibs.sh" and having the autotools generate the necessary files "./autogen.sh".

### Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian based Linux distributions such as Ubuntu install the following packages:
```
sudo apt install ${git_apt_dependencies}
```

### Fedora

On Fedora based Linux distributions install the following packages:
```
sudo dnf install ${git_dnf_dependencies}
```

### macOS

On macOS the XCode command line tools no longer provide the autotools you can obtain them e.g. via [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/).
Install the following packages:
```
sudo port install ${git_macports_dependencies}
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio

Since Microsoft Visual Studio does not come with a Unix shell or equivalent you'll need to use the Windows PowerShell scripts instead:
```
git clone ${project_git_url}
cd ${project_name}\
${git_msvscpp_dependencies}
.\autogen.ps1
```
