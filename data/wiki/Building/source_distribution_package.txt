## Source distribution package

To retrieve the source distribution package go to the [downloads](${project_downloads_url}) page and download the file named:

```
${project_name}${project_status}-<version>.tar.gz
```

To extract the source distribution package run:

```
tar xfv ${project_name}${project_status}-<version>.tar.gz
```

This will create the source directory:

```
${project_name}-<version>
```

### Verification

The source distribution package can be verified with the corresponding .asc file:

```
gpg --verify ${project_name}${project_status}-<version>.tar.gz.asc ${project_name}${project_status}-<version>.tar.gz
```

Where the corresponding public key can be found on [keyserver.ubuntu.com](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?fingerprint=on&op=index&search=0x0ED9020DA90D3F6E70BD3945D9625E5D7AD0177E)

A successful verification will look similar to:

```
gpg: Signature made Sun 01 Jan 2017 09:28:04 AM CET using RSA key ID 7AD0177E
gpg: lookup_hashtable failed: eof
gpg: Good signature from "Joachim Metz <joachim.metz@gmail.com>"
gpg: lookup_hashtable failed: eof
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!

```

An unsuccessful verification will look similar to:

```
gpg: Signature made Sun 01 Jan 2017 09:28:04 AM CET using RSA key ID 7AD0177E
gpg: lookup_hashtable failed: eof
