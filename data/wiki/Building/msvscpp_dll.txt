## Using the DLL
Make sure you use define ${project_name:upper_case}_DLL_IMPORT before including <${project_name}.h>.

To be able to use the DLL on other systems than the build system you'll also need to provide:
* the Microsoft Visual C++ Run-Time DLL (part of the Visual C++ Redistributable package)
${msvscpp_dll_dependencies}
