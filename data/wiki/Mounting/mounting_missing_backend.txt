If you get the error:
```
No sub system to mount ${library_name_suffix_upper_case}.
```

That means fuse was not detected when building the ${tools_name}, check if you have fuse-dev installed and if ./configure is able to detect it.
The last part of the ./configure output shows you this in an overview.
