## Windows
To mount ${mount_tool_source_description} on Windows:
```
${mount_tool_name}${mount_tool_additional_arguments} ${mount_tool_source} x:
```

At the moment the ${mount_tool_name} keeps a hold on the console.

This will expose ${mount_tool_mounted_description}.
```
X:\${mount_tool_file_entry_example_windows}
```
